1	My jobs are broad about and at early stage startups	1
2	Come up with a DG labs pitch for accelerators	1
3	Michigan Founder's Fund meets at Start Garden once a month -- \\"founder's first friday\\"	1
4	MSU organization is *not* just for MSU people -- it's called Conquer	1
5	I'm very good at identifying problem trends in news, analyzing root causes, and analyzing possible solutions	1
6	Mention my information science education/training and introduction to concepts like information asymmetries and information overload	1
7	I'm incubating Datagotchi Labs to be about addressing these issues (in underserved markets/communities?) and finding novel business models to support them	1
8	Mention interdisciplinary vs multidisciplinary: my backgrounds + DG's multiple focuses	1
9	The key is documenting things (information)	1
10	For MI-centric messaging, maybe focus on local hires rather than remote gig workers	1
11	Either way, become an expert at building teams (with Counteroffer?)	1
12	Maybe pitch startup incubation based on stakeholder empathy	1
13	But unless I get donations up front, perhaps with equity promises (profit dividends), this will take forever and not make much money	1
14	I'd have to brand myself as very good at early & ongoing research, mvp testing, problem-solving, etc...	1
15	Also my experience in R&D, startups in SF, and early DG Labs (wearing many hats)	1
16	Don't forget about consulting and coaching about these lessons -- after documenting them and *organizing* them	1
17	I worked for startups to learn how they commercialize their technologies. So my heart is really in new technology R&D	1
18	DG, Inspect, and CO initial ideas are low profit margin and slow growth, so investors won't be interested	1
19	Could pitch the interpretable analytics now	1
20	With my skills, EIR @ SG would be great (focused on nearly stage opportunity discovery &  validation) -- ask Laurie or her contact?	1
21	Come up with an argument that empathy improves R&D/startups/or something	1
22	Empathy makes your startup more resilient in the face of changing markets because you can more easily hypothesize what stakeholders need even if they didn't tell you directly	1
23	Create a proxy, so I can use one easy to instance for all three projects	1
24	Reduce ec2 size while it's just me	1
25	Show product name \\u003E item type \\u003E item name on modal	2
26	Enable custom trend types	2
